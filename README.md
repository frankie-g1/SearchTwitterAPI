# SearchTwitterAPI

Future plans:
  Implement a second search method.

  With Twitter API access, the API's post method scrapes Twitter API with Python's Tweepy module for ten tweets. These 10 tweets are inserted as the tuple (user's filters, tweet id, and tweet text) into the sqlite3 database.
  
  
  Side note the database stays small by deleting previous entries found with the same keywords.

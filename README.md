# SearchTwitterAPI

Future plans:
  Implement tweepy to return the tweets found through the submit fields keywords.

  Without Twitter API access, the API's post method inserts the tuple (user's filters, fake tweet id 203102831123, and fake tweet text "Postman") into the sqlite3 database.
  
  
  The Get method isn't ready yet. I need to read up on Flask's documentation to have the API understand requests with the route /tweets?see_tweets=user's filters
